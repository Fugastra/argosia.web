  <p id = "socials">Welcome to the birth of my blog. For today I don't have much to say execpt that setting this page up was a hassle. I don't know why, but the CSS elements weren't loading for the new elements at least. Went with a very crude method. Library closes at 1700, it's already 1600, so I'll quickly finish this section up before I go and peruse the main library building. I should someday do a Library review. There's still a lot to do, but it's the holidays so I get to spend as much time on this as I can.</p>

  <p id = "socials">I'll have to reformat my homepage someday, maybe later in the afternoon. That's up to future me to decide, however present me is still concerned with the calculus exercise on hand at the moment. (Note to future me, I did not use the school resources, they haven't given them to me yet, I'm using a book called <em>Foundational Calculus</em>, check <a href = "read.html">reading list</a>) Anyways, I just finished the last chapter on the rules of differentiation, now I'm gonna take a crack at differentiation of chain functions, wish me luck. Turns out no, it was not that simple, and I'm going to give up for today, still got 2 months to slowly prep anyways.</p>

  <p id = "socials">I'm going to go insane with trying to update my Arch system today. I've tried everything, and its not working, the problem is I don't know why. I mean I ran all the right commands and stuff, now I'm just throwing everything at the wall and see what sticks. The problem was an invalid PGP signature, yes I got my keyrings updated, but now its telling me my wifi -- wait I think I know why now. 90% sure its an internet thing, as I'm outside in a spot with busy wifi. Imma go home now and see if it really is the wifi.</p>

  <p id = "socials">So I was reading through my blog this morning and I found a funny pattern. Apparently I've been updating this thing on 3 day intervals, which then I remembered, hey, its been three days since my last update, so I've decided to edit it here lol. Anyways, here's an update to my last entry on updating my computer, it worked! I don't know how or why, it just worked. Here's a tutorial I guess for this: <br>
    1. For GPG key errors, try manually resetting keys -> removing the key folder and resetting keys <br>
    2. Try setting $DISPLAY to 0 -> unset $DISPLAY will do as well <br>
    3. For the conflicting files error try -> # pacman -Rdd linux-firmware # pacman -Syu linux-firmware <br>
    4. Also check if the time is out of sync <br>
    5. UPDATE YOUR SYSTEM EVERY 2 WEEKS!! (minimum) <br>
    Keeping your Arch install healthy is important! :) <br>
