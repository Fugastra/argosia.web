  <p id= "mainp">Welcome to Fugastra's website, I'm the creator of this website. Oh btw, the colour scheme is Gruvbox-dark. Anyways, here's a bit about myself. I'm currently a student, studying somewhere in Asia. I consider myself to be a bit of a computer nerd. (I use arch btw, with hyprland). Am a huge advocate for FOSS software, I also like the indie web 'cause it gives me near endless customization options. Like, going on a side tangent here, Youtube, Instagram(people over here use a lot of instagram, or any meta software) etc. only allows you to only change your profile picture, banner etc. I mean, to a certain degree its fine, but I'm the type of person to spend days,weeks even, customizing my desktop to look like it came straight out of Oliver Byrne's *Elements of Euclid*, possibly breaking a few important dependencies and causing myself pain. So, yes please give me more options to customize my socials so I can express myself, no it's not a phase. >:P</p>

    I just remembered this while finishing up this section of my website. I totally forgot to explain the origins of my online persona. The english half of my persona has an extremely funny origin that for simplicity's sake is actually a shorthand of a translated phrase referencing a video game, that I thought was cool (r/I'm14andthisisdeep type stuff), but I like the sound of it and it kinda stuck. For the other half, if you know me in real life (which you don't), then you'll know that I have 2 names :sunglasses:, and that the other name that isn't English has a logograph that not a lot of people know how to pronounce -- 萑. I managed to find (through a 2 hour research journey on the internet) the origin of the logograph, at least according to a credible online dictionary, which came from a line in a poem written around 2000 years ago. And so I took the first half of that poem and turned it into my internet handle. :)
